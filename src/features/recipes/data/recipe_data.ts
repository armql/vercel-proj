        about: "This caper and feta-spiked dip will have you double and triple dipping!",
        preparation: "Preheat oven to 375.\n  In a high sided skillet or dutch oven, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add in spinach and cook until wilted and some of the moisture has evaporated. Add in artichoke hearts, grated garlic, and capers and cook until fragrant and warmed through.\n  Turn the heat to low, then add the cream cheese. Cook until it has melted, then add in the greek yogurt and stir to combine.\n  Remove the pan from the heat, and fold in the feta and most of the shredded mozzarella, reserving some for topping. Transfer the mixture to a baking dish, top with remaining mozzarella, then bake for 15 minutes, or until bubbly and browned on top. If after 15 minutes it hasn’t browned, broil for 1-2 minutes for desired crispiness.\n Serve with pita chips and crudité.",
